Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    A block starts on a new line and takes up the whole width. Inline elements take up as much width as necessary and does not start on a new line.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        It is positioned relative to its ancestor element. If there is no ancestor, it will position relative to the body document.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        YOU can use a flexbox.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        block: p, footer, section
        inline: <a> <br>
        inline-block: <img>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

    The box model describes the space around the content of the element. There are different types of spaces around the content. We have the padding, which is the space between the border and the content. Then we have a border which surrounds the content. The space between the border and the outside is the margin. 

    If you wnat to have a set width you need to make sure you declare the size you want for all four parts: margin,padding, border, and content.
